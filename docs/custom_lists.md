# Custom Lists

With **Shopping List** App you can create custom shopping lists to better organize your shopping.

To create a new list, just tap the button ![](https://github.com/andreamussap/AFMussap-Tech-Shopping-List/tree/master/docs/images/shop-list-button-new-list.png "Create new List").
In the window **Create a new list**, choose a color and type the name of the list. Then, tap **Create**.

Don't worry about capitalizing the list's name. Type all words in lowercase, and the App will capitalize every word for you. For instance, if you type: **my market**, the list will be created as *My Market*.

You can also include numbers and *emoji* in the name of the list.

> If you try to use a name that already exists, the App will display a message: Ops, List name already exists

> If you don't type any name, or try to use special characters, such as **{([.$#/\])}**, the App will display a message: Ops, you can't use {([.$#/\])} or an empty list name

You can choose among five different colors create your lists and quickly identify them.
