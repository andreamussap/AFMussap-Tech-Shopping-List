# Tutorial - Custom Lists

With **Shopping List** App you can create custom lists to better organize your shopping.

## Create a New List

To create a new list, tap the button 'Add'

In the window **Create a new list**, choose a color and type the name of the list. Then, tap **Create**.

> Don't worry about capitalizing the list's name. Type everything in lowercase, and the App will capitalize every word for you. For instance, if you type: **my market**, the list will be created as **My Market**.


You can also use numbers and *emoji* in the name of the list.

* If you try to use a name that already exists, the App will display a message: *Ops, List name already exists*

* If you don't type anything or try to use special characters, such as {([.$#/\])}, the App will display a message: *Ops, you can't use {([.$#/\])} or an empty list name*


You can choose among five different colours to create your lists.
