# Tutorial - Menu Options

At the upper-right corner of your lists you can find a Menu with five options:

* Check all items
* Uncheck all items
* Remove all items values
* Remove all checked items
* Remove all items

## Check all items

By tapping this option, you're selecting (~~strikethrough~~) all items from your list at once.

> Just remember that the selection of an item doesn't decrease its value from the sum. This option is to help you to know what items are already purchased.

## Uncheck all items

This option comes in handy when you want to **reuse** the items of the list: you deselect all of them at once to use the same items again.

## Remove all items values

This is another option for the **reuse** of the list: whether you want to reuse the entire list or just some of its items, you can remove all values at once and type them again while doing your shopping.

> This option changes all 'values' to 0 (zero) and 'quantity' to 1 (one).

## Remove all checked items

You can use this option to remove the items that you've purchased, and you know that you won't buy them again using this same list.

## Remove all items

This option clears your list. It makes your list like new so you can start a new one from the beginning.
