## The **Shopping List** App allows you to create shopping lists with several practical features

Custom Lists

For better organization you can create lists with different colors. It is possible to include numbers and _emoji_ in the name of the lists.
To *edit* or *delete* a list, simply slide its name to the right and select the desired option.

Items

Items can be grouped through a simple color system to help you to organize your list into sections, for instance.
Tap the item to strikethrough it, signaling that it has already been purchased. To deselect it, tap the item again.
Slide the item to the right, so you can *edit* or *delete* it.

Total Amount

No more surprises when it comes to paying for your purchases! For each quantity and price inserted, the App displays the sum of the purchase at the end of the list.

Other Features

You also have the options of adding a new item through **Google's native voice recognition**; Strikethrough the item that you already put in your shopping cart; or you can use the **Menu** options to select and deselect all items at once; remove all item's values; delete all selected items, or delete all items from your list.
