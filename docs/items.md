# Tutorial - Items

After you follow the steps from the previous section [Custom Lists](https://github.com/andreamussap/AFMussap-Tech-Shopping-List/blob/master/docs/custom_lists.md) and create a new list, you can start to add items to the list.

## Add Items to the List

In the same way you did to create your list, just tap the button 'Add' to add a new item.

In the window **Add a new item**, you either can type or use Google's native voice recognition to add it.

After write or speech the name of the item, just tap **NEW** to add the item to the list.

> The list is ordered alphabetically.

It's possible to use the colour system to group items by section or similarity. This can help you to save time while doing your shopping. For example, for a market shopping list you can group fruits and vegetable in green, frozen food in blue, bakery in pink, etc.

*Example of a list using different colours:*

> Each coloured block is a sub-list inside your list.

While shopping, once you put an item into the basket, select it (~~strikethrough it~~) for you to know what's already purchased. For that, just tap the item. 
The selected item is sent to the end of the list of the coloured block that it belongs.

*Example of ~~selected~ items:*

To deselect the item, tap it again.

In the same way, to *delete* a list just slide it to the right and tap the button:

At the end of this tutorial, you will have your Shopping list populated with its items.
