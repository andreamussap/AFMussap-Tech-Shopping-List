After write or speech the name of the item, tap **NEW** to add the item to the list. 

> The list is ordered alphabetically.

It's possible to use the colour system to group items by section or similarity. This helps you to save time while doing your shopping. For example, for a market shopping list you can group fruits and vegetables in green, frozen food in blue, bakery in pink, etc.

> Each coloured block is a sub-list inside your list.

While shopping, once you put an item into the basket, select it (~~strikethrough it~~) for you to know what's already purchased. To select an item, just tap it. 

The selected item is sent to the end of the list of the coloured block that it belongs.
