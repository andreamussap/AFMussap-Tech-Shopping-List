# Tutorial - Sum

When you fill in the value and quantity for an item, the **Shopping List** App promptly displays the sum of you purchase. Similary, if you remove or change the value or quantity, the sum is updated.

> The selection (~~strikethrough~~) of an item doesn't decrease its value from the sum.
